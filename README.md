# Prices-forecast
This project was created for short-term forecasting of prices for consumer goods.
The sample data is presented in the file "Prices", the main model (SARIMAX) in the file "Main model". Additional models were developed as part of hypothesis testing and are left here to demonstrate an alternative approach.
Forecasting accuracy for the main model by the MAPE (mean absolute percentage errors) metric is 98-99%.
